                        The Splash, is an unique identifier for Spectra, as the InChI Key is an unique identifier for
                        chemical compounds.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first implementation of the Splash, was the MoNA (<a
                            href="http://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">Massbank of North America</a>) hash
                        and during the 2015 Metabolomics conference in turned out that people like the idea of an unique
                        spectra identifier, similar to the InChI Key. Based on the received feedback, a subset of the
                        attendies started to develop a set of specifications, which allowed us to easily calculate
                        unique and short identifiers for a wide range of Spectra. This includes MS, IR, UV and NMR
                        spectra at this point.
                    </p>

                    <p>If you like to contribute to the development of the splash or just want to let us know what you
                        think
                        about the concept, please contact us at <a

                        The main usage of the splash is to be used as database identifier, as well as easily allowing
                        you to see if 2 spectra are similar to each other. We hope that people will adopt it in their
                        systems as well, so we can easily compute overlap of databases or use it to reference spectra
                        between publications.
